# KinopoiskApp
As a task, you should write an android application with a list of films and their
description.
The [unofficial movie search API](https://kinopoiskapiunofficial.tech/) will act as the data source for our application.
## Basic requirements for the application:
- On the main screen, you need to display a list of popular movies.
- Each movie card on the main page should contain the following elements
1. Name of the film.
2. Movie poster image.
3. Year of release.
- Clicking on a card opens a screen with a movie poster, description, genre, country
production.
- If the network is not available or an error occurs during the download process, you must provide
notifying the user about it.
## Optional requirements, but it will be good if you can implement them:
- When changing the orientation of the device, the movie list takes up only 50% of the screen, in the second
half will display a description of the movie.
- On the main screen there are sections "Popular" and "Favorites". By long clicking on
card, the movie is placed in favorites and stored in the database. Movie cards from
favorites are available offline.
- When viewing popular, films that are in favorites are highlighted.
- In the sections, you can search for films by title (according to the selected section).
